## Overview

The select panel allows you to select one or multiple items from a list, and it can be enhanced with additional controls like a search input to expedite the selection process. It is often used to augment information of a wide variety of items.

For instance, you may encounter a select panel when you need to assign someone to a task or add labels to an issue or pull request. It can also be utilized to select a specific branch in a code repository.

It's important to understand the differences between the select panel and [action menu](/components/action-menu). The primary distinction lies in the fact that an action menu lacks the ability to include additional form controls and automatically closes after making a selection. Therefore, if you require a filterable list or the capability to make multiple selections at once, the select panel is the appropriate choice.

## Anatomy

  alt="Select panel for assigning labels to an issue. 'Apply labels to this issue' heading, close button in upper right hand corner. Search input with a magnifer icon as a visible label, listbox of label options and the first three are selected with a visual checkbox. The footer contains a button to edit labels, and cancel and apply buttons. Purple labels are overlayed onto select panel: Overlay (dialog) pointing to the container, Search input pointing to the input, role='listbox' bracket of the listbox content, Optional action control to the button in the lower left corner, Explicit confirm / submission buttons bracket for the apply and cancel buttons in the lower right corner."

/>

The select panel is composed of three main areas: a header, a scrollable list, and an optional footer.

- **Header:** The header always includes a title and a close button. Additionally, it can have an optional search/filter field to find items quicker. When a selection is made, a "clear all" button should also be present.
- **List (scrollable):** The scrollable list consists of [action list](/components/action-list) items, which can be either single or multi-select options.
- **Footer (Optional):** In most cases, especially in multi-select scenarios, the select panel includes a footer that incorporates a "Cancel" and an "Apply" button also refered to as declaritive actions. If any additional controls are required, such as an extra checkbox or button, a footer becomes necessary as well.

## Options

The select panel provides flexibility by offering both simple list-based single selection and multi-selection options. Additionally, it can become more sophisticated by incorporating advanced features such as filtering functionality and the inclusion of links.

<img
  width="960"
  alt="First select panel is a branch switcher control that includes tabs, a search input, a listbox with single-select items, and a footer with an All branches link, and cancel and apply buttons. Second select panel is titled 'Show fields, with a list of about 10 multi-select items and apply and cancel buttons in the footer."
  src="https://github.com/primer/design/assets/980622/17c26b4f-e4ac-4120-8714-1bfffc2b73da"
/>

### Trigger

<img width="960" alt="" src="https://github.com/primer/design/assets/980622/f2867468-4606-4999-8ea7-21860e50051d" />

Select panels can be activated by either a regular [button](/components/button), [icon button](/components/icon-button) or [action menu item](/components/action-menu). If the button is intended to represent the current selection, it's crucial to have a label associated with it, either internally (within the button) or externally (adjacent to the button).

### List (single select)

<img
  width="960"
  alt="Multi-select"
  src="https://github.com/primer/design/assets/980622/3d0cc2b5-b958-4b62-805e-f77a9d7bf0d9"
/>

If the select panel doesn't have an additional checkbox in the footer, you can make an instant selection. This means that the select panel will close as soon as you make the selection.

However, if there is an additional form element required for that selection, such as checking an additional option, it is necessary to have a cancel and confirmation button. This prevents the dialog from unexpectedly closing when you click an option, allowing you to review and confirm your selection.

To indicate an instant selection, we use checkmarks to show the selected option. For regular single selects, we use visually styled radio buttons. Note they are not semantically radio buttons.

### List (multi-select)

<img
  width="960"
  alt="Multi-select"
  src="https://github.com/primer/design/assets/980622/33176d07-2853-4318-bf5d-df395e700fa9"
/>

The multi-select list allows you to choose multiple items from a list and has additional features like **select all** or **indeterminate selections**.

The **select all** option at the top of the list allows for quickly deselecting or selecting all values.
However, when you separate items in groups this option isn't available anymore.

Additionally, It can only be used when all available options can be returned. As an example, if the list is too large to retrieve all options at once such as API endpoints returning limited results then this feature may not be suitable.
We should refrain from putting a strain on API endpoints to return all the possible results at once as this could result in a performance downgrade in a scenario of large lists as virtualization is currently not built into this component.

The **indeterminate selections** option is useful for performing bulk actions on lists. For example, if you have 20 selected items, but some of them have different labels attached, an indeterminate checkbox (represented by a horizontal line) is shown for labels that are not set on all items.

### Footer

<img
  width="1388"
  alt="Footers"
  src="https://github.com/primer/design/assets/980622/85bcb93b-3d39-4635-ad1b-68243dae6bd9"
/>

The optional footer at the bottom could include a single link, button or
checkbox to take additional actions.

In case of a multi selection or a single selection with additional actions in the footer, we recommend a "Cancel" and "Apply" button unless you clearly [understand the accessibility implications](#cancelsubmit) of not adding this.

### Current selection

<img width="960" alt="" src="https://github.com/primer/design/assets/980622/ab147e61-7088-4113-99b6-740e9bcbfe40" />

To provide a summary of the current selection, it is essential to display the selected items at the beginning of the unfiltered list. This behavior should only occur after users clear the search input or close and reopen the select panel. Avoiding the immediate reordering of items after selection is crucial to prevent disorienting and confusing the users.

### Error/Warning

<img
  width="1466"
  alt="Error"
  src="https://github.com/primer/design/assets/980622/135d597a-33cd-4ba1-a86b-241a1b5bdfcb"
/>

Sometimes, we encounter situations where things don't work as expected, or we need to inform users about something important. There are various ways to handle these scenarios depending on the situation.

For instance, if the default values fail to load initially, we display an error placeholder to let the user know that something went wrong.

When the initial values are loaded and the user performs a search for new values, there may be instances where the search fails. In such cases, it is essential to ensure that the user can still make a selection without losing their current selection. Instead, we display an error message at the top of the list, notifying the user about the search failure while preserving their ability to continue with their selection process.

### Empty state

<img
  width="960"
  alt="Error"
  src="https://github.com/primer/design/assets/980622/57386be3-6e16-4862-b557-d14533b3ef28"
/>

When no results are available, it is essential to offer users an explanation instead of leaving a blank space. There can be various reasons for the absence of results. It could be due to the search or filter input value not matching any available data, or it could be because the user has yet to generate any data to display.

### Limited selections

<img
  width="960"
  alt="First select panel is a branch switcher control that includes tabs, a search input, a listbox with single-select items, and a footer with an All branches link, and cancel and apply buttons. Second select panel is titled 'Show fields, with a list of about 10 multi-select items and apply and cancel buttons in the footer."
  src="https://github.com/primer/design/assets/980622/9cacdd30-99b3-4571-b37f-3066b7219ab2"
/>

In certain situations, we may need to restrict the number of items a user can select, either due to infrastructure limitations or limitations based on paid features. It is important to inform the user about this restriction before they begin making their selection. The description can be used effectively to communicate this limitation.

When the user reaches the maximum allowed number of selections, we need to display a warning message indicating that they have reached their limit. This can also be an opportunity to provide a link for upgrading their account if the restriction is related to a paid feature. It is worth noting that the warning message is labeled with an `aria-live` attribute, ensuring that users with screen readers receive a notification when the message appears.

### Loading

It is important to provide visual cues to the user when certain processes may take longer than expected. Loading states can be utilized at different stages of using this component to communicate this information effectively.

<img width="1668" alt="" src="https://github.com/primer/design/assets/980622/93b6b99c-368b-403c-b604-a1f50920a1ef" />

1. **Initial**: Should be used when retrieving the initial data to prevent users from seeing an empty list.
2. **Initial (skeleton)**: Should be used when retrieving the initial data to prevent users from seeing an empty list.
3. **Searching/Filtering**: When users perform a search to fetch new items, it is important to maintain their current selections or allow them to continue making selections. In this case, a more minimal loading state should be used to indicate ongoing activity.
4. **Confirmation**: If your layout does not incorporate optimistic updates or lacks error messaging for failed updates, it is crucial to use a confirmation button as a loading state to clearly communicate the progress of the update.

By employing these loading states, users can have a better understanding of the process and remain informed throughout their interactions with the component.

### Search/Filtering

Including a search or filter input field not only accelerates the selection process for users but also prevents the need to burden the browser or API endpoints with returning extensive lists of items.

    <Caption>Don’t place the search/filter input in the scrollable area.</Caption>
  </Dont>
</DoDontContainer>

Adopting a smart approach of returning a limited number of items at a time can significantly enhance speed and potentially eliminate the necessity for searching altogether. For instance, instead of presenting the first 20 labels in alphabetical order, providing the most commonly used labels can be more effective. This strategic implementation optimizes the selection process and improves user experience.

### Items

Select panels are designed to be lightweight and should not be overloaded with excessive information. For instance, when using a user picker, it is often sufficient to include essential details such as the username, full name, and avatar. Less relevant information, such as the total number of followers or location, can be omitted as it is not as crucial for the selection process.

</DoDontContainer>

Items accompanied by a checkmark icon, as opposed to radio buttons or checkboxes, indicate that the selection panel will automatically close upon making a choice. Therefore, they cannot be used in conjunction with declarative buttons.

When an additional checkbox is added to the footer, declarative buttons are required, and the items should be accompanied by visually resembling radio buttons. Although they are not technically radio buttons in terms of semantics, using visual radio buttons can effectively convey that the selection process is not yet complete even after making a choice.

### Clearing

Within the select panel, there are multiple ways to clear data. This can involve either clearing the search/filter input or clearing the current selection. It is crucial to avoid confusing their functionality, as one is related to the list itself, while the other pertains solely to the search/filter input.

### Action menu trigger

When the select panel is activated through an [action menu](/components/action-menu), it should be displayed as a modal dialog. It should never be shown as a submenu.

## Behavior

### Appearance

<img width="1338" alt="" src="https://github.com/primer/design/assets/980622/ff89b152-0929-46c1-b87a-1158504946ad" />

The select panel can appear as a nonmodal dialog or modal dialog.

- **Nonmodal dialog**: When triggered by a [button](/components/button) or [icon button](/components/icon-button) but never by an [action menu](/components/action-menu).
- **Modal dialog**: When triggered by a [button](/components/button), [icon button](/components/icon-button) or [action menu](/components/action-menu).

On smaller breakpoints the select panel should always appear as a modal dialog.

### Opening

<img
  width="960"
  alt="Mouse cursor hovering over an icon button and a focused icon button with the space and enter keys visually below the icon button."
  src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40274682/228910118-3d99fd0a-7b14-4e46-af48-f69bf76912e5.png"
/>

The select panel can be activated through a semantic button, providing mouse users with the ability to click on it, while keyboard users can activate it by pressing the space or enter key.

Additionally, the select panel can be triggered through an action menu. In this scenario, it is important for the action menu to promptly close as soon as the select panel is triggered.

<img
  width="960"
  alt="First select panel has focus applied to the search input with a blue 2px border. Second select panel has no visible focus ring as focus is brought to the H1 of the dialog."
  src="https://github.com/primer/design/assets/980622/fd6a6028-2402-48cb-9d28-693c54f79ac5"
/>

Focus should be placed on the first interactive item within select panel.

### Closing

### Responsive

On smaller viewports, the select panel can be transformed into either a full-screen dialog or a bottom sheet dialog. To ensure usability on touch devices, the confirmation buttons and action list items are also increased to a medium size, ensuring a sufficiently large hit target.

When adding an extra action in the footer, it is important to ensure that it still fits within a 320px viewport.

See the [Dialog guidelines](https://primer.style/design/components/dialog) for more details.

## Cancel/submit

In most scenarios, we recommend using declarative controls, except for some single-select instances as [demonstrated earlier](#list-single-select).
However, we acknowledge that in specific areas of the product that users interact with frequently throughout the day, employing declarative controls may create the perception of a sluggish experience.
For example, if the issue creation process involves too many steps, it may discourage customers from reporting issues.

We are currently [conducting internal experiments](https://github.com/github/platform-ux/issues/1327) to validate those considerations, while closely collaborating with our accessibility auditors to ensure the optimal experience for all users.

Our current position on ommiting declaritive buttons takes in account a mix of considerations:

- **Reversibility**: If the selection has the potential to initiate workflows or send notifications that cannot be easily reversed, then it is not appropriate to make an exception.
- **Passive selections**: Exceptions are more warranted when dealing with selections that are part of a larger form and are not submitted until the user presses the "Send" button. In such cases, it is crucial to ensure that upon closing the select panel, the focus is returned to the trigger element and that this indicates the selection. Passive selections can also be defined as selections that do not directly modify the database.
- **Frequency of use**: Exceptions are less warranted for settings pages since they are not frequently used. On the other hand, creating an issue is a task that can occur multiple times a day, making an exception more justified in this case.

### Examples
